                                                 Hello! My name is Emma Ablao. I was born and raised in San Jose, California.
                                                 I am currently 19 years old. My mother is from Vietnam, and my father is from the Philippines.
                                                 I am an older sister to my only younger sibling, my brother. I also have two pet cats.

                                               </p>
                                             </div>

                                             <div class=aboutmepic>

                                             </div>

                                               <p>
                                                  I graduated high school summa cum laude in June 2021. I did community college at West Valley and De Anza Community College starting my sophomore year of high school.
                                                   I did community college for a couple of years, then transferred to where I am today, San Francisco State University. I am in my junior year of college, and my major is Visual Communications Design.
