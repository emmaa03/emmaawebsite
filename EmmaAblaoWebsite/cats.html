                                             <p>These are my two cats, Koa and Koi. Koa is the older of the two, he is three years old. He has black and white fur, green/yellow eyes, pink and black toes, and a clipped left ear.
                                             Koi is the younger one, at two years old. He has orange and white fur, yellow eyes, pink toes, and a clipped left ear.</p>
                                             <p>
                                               Koa is the first pet my family has ever gotten. His name means warrior/brave one, originating from Hawaii. In July 2019, my family and I were about to go to the Gilroy Garlic Festival, but changed our minds and went
                                               to adopt Koa after meeting him for the first time a couple days prior. After adopting him, we heard about the tragic incidence of a shooting that took place at the festival we were about to go to.
                                             </p>
                                             <p>
                                               My family decided to get Koi during the COVID-19 Pandemic. His name means urge/implore, also originating from Hawaii. We also chose his name due to the orange and white colors some Koi fish have. We wanted to have a new family member,
                                               and give Koa someone to be friends with. Due to social distancing, we could not meet him in person, but we fell in love with him over Facetime when he got pet he would stick his butt up.
